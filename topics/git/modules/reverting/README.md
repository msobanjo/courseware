## Reviewing the history of a repository

The best way to view commit history is by using the following command:

```bash
git log
```

This command will show you the history of all commits for the current branch, with the output including: date, commit message and the SHA-1 identifying hash.

There are also additional flags that make this command easier to use, such as:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

Using `--oneline` flag simplifies the output into one line per commit.

```bash
git log --branches=*
```

By using the `--branches=*` flag, we are making Git return the history of all commits for all the branches in that repository.

To get the data for a specific branch, the log command would need to be used like this:

```bash
# git log [BRANCH_NAME]
git log master
```

## Reverting to a previous commit with revert

Let's assume that your `git log --oneline` looks similar to this:

```text
 875f31e (HEAD -> master) fourth commit
 483856a third commit
 2dd011d second commit
 bcabb84 first commit
 ```

If we execute:

`git revert HEAD`

Git will create a new commit, which will do the opposite of the previous commit (for example, if you added a piece of code you didn't need, the revert would create a commit deleting this piece of code). You can also use revert to go back to a specific SHA-1 (`483856a` for example).

The history will still contain the fourth commit, but it's changes will be undone. Using `revert` allows us to use the same branch and is considered the better solution for reverting.

## Reverting with reset

Instead of using `git revert` in the situation above, we could have used:

`git reset --hard 483856a`

This command will return the state to the selected commit (`483856a third commit`).

The difference between this and `git revert` is that now the Git history will no longer contain the fourth commit, and work would continue as if the `fourth commit` never happened.

However, not having the commit reflected in the commit history can cause complications when working with a shared remote repository.

If the reset happened to a commit that is already shared with others, and we tried to push some changes afterwards,
Git would throw an error; this is because it would think that our local Git history isn't up to date. In these scenarios, it's more appropriate to use the `revert` strategy.

### Using Revert to go Back to the Latest Commit
If you have made a lot of changes and just want to back to the latest commit that was made then you can use `reset` without specifying a SHA1:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

## Tutorial
1. Create a folder called "tmp"
2. Initialise the folder as a git repository
3. Create a new file called `test.txt`
5. Stage the file and commit, with an explicit commit message
6. Repeat the previous two steps (using a different file name each time) until you have done 5 commits
7. Now check the git log history for the branch you are on (try out the additional flags for viewing the git log history)
8. Use the `git revert HEAD` command to 'undo' the last commit you did
9. Use the `ls` command to see what happened
10. Use the `reset` command to go back to your first commit
11. Use the `ls` command to see what happened
12. Check the history for the branch you're working on.

## Overview
When we refer to **security** in modern computing, we tend to think about two things:
 - how secure information is against **attacks**
 - how much **access** to information we grant to people

## Attacks
No information which relies on a computer is every truly secure.

Therefore, securing that information from attack from as many angles as possible is paramount.

Attacks on information come in many forms, and can be done for several *reasons*:
 - **theft** - sensitive information with a high economic or social value, such as bank account or identity details, is commonly stolen
 - **sabotage** - important records, such as order information or passwords, may be changed or destroyed
 - **exposure** - leaking of crucial information from within a private network to outside of it 

Attacks on information can be classified by *origin point*:
 - **internal** - devices operating on the same private network, such as those used by company employees
 - **external** - a third party, such as an indiscriminate hacker, uses their device to gain access to a private network

 Attacks can also be classified by the attacker's *intent*:
  - **malicious** - deliberate, co-ordinated and intentional, such as in emails which link you to a replica of a legitimate website
  - **unintentional** - information becomes compromised through human error, such as leaving a resource unlocked or badly-secured by accident
  - **constructive** - an attack is made with the intent of exposing holes within a security system, such as when stress-testing

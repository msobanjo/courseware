## Overview
Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server that can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.
Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

## Installation
### Docker (Any Platform)
You will, of course, need Docker installed. However, with Docker, you can use the following command to install Jenkins:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins/jenkins:lts-alpine
```
### Windows
An installer can be downloaded and ran to get Jenkins running on Windows here: https://jenkins.io/download/
### Linux
There is a script (`jenkins-install.sh`) in this directory that you can use to install Jenkins on popular Linux distributions, like Debian/Ubuntu, CentOS & RHEL.
Please note, if you are using the script then you will need to have sudo access on the machine you execute it on.
Simply run this script on the machine you wish to install it on, and execute it like this:
```bash
./jenkins-install.sh
```

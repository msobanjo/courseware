## Overview

Azure Resource Manager is the deployment and management service in Azure.

It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update and delete resources in your Azure subscription.

## Benefits

* Allows you to create and manage infrastructure through declarative templates, rather than scripts

* Deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group, instead of individually

* Apply access control to all services in a resource group

* Apply tags to resources to logically organise them

* View the costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag, which can allow clarity when dealing with billing.

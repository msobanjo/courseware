# Serverless Computing

## Overview

Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminatin the need for them to manage infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Management

With serverless computing, the cloud service provider (in this case, Microsoft) automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastrcture required to run the code.

**IMPORTANT** - *Serverless* doesn't actually mean without servers! It just means that the servers are managed by the cloud service provider and not the customer.

Of course, **servers are still needed** somewhere to run the code.

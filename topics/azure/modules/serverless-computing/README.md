## Overview

Serverless computing enables developers to build applications faster by eliminatin the need for them to manage infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Management

With serverless computing, the cloud service provider (in this case, Microsoft) automatically provisions, scales and manages the infrastrcture required to run the code.

**IMPORTANT** - *Serverless* doesn't actually mean without servers! It just means that the servers are managed by the cloud service provider and not the customer.

Of course, **servers are still needed** somewhere to run the code.

## Benefits

Developing in this way allows developers to **increase their focus on the business logic**, delivering more value to the core of the business.

It also helps boost team productivity by bringing **products to market faster**.

In summary, the main benefits are:

* No Infrastructure Management
* Dynamic Scalability
* Faster Time to Market
* More Efficient use of Resources

## Some Serverless Services

Microsoft Azure offers many services that can work in a serverless way. These include:

* Functions
* Logic Apps
* Event Grid
* Service Bus
* Kubernetes Service

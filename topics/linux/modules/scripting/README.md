## Overview
These are some scripting tasks. 
See if you can create scripts that do the tasks the excercises ask for. 
Don't forget to give your script executable permissions.

## Excercise 1
Write a script that excepts a username as an input and returns if that username is logged in or not.

## Excercise 2
Write a script that does the follwing:
    
    - Creates a new directory inside your home directory
    - Creates 2 .txt files
    - Moves one of the file outside the directory
    - Renames that file to test1.txt
    - Renames the second file to test2.sh
    - Make test2.sh a script that prints the working directory
    - Execute that script

Make this script executable from everywhere.

## Excercise 3
Write a script that takes a url as user input and then returns whether that website exists.

## Excercise 4
Write a script that takes a file as user input and returns whether the file exists and if so, the full path to that file.

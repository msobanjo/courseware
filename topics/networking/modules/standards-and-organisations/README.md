## Overview
The internet, as a collection of worldwide networks, requires policies, procedures, standards and protocols to make it work.
The Internet Society (ISOC) was founded in 1992 by [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) and [Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) to promote the open development, evolution and use of the internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world.
The internet has a unique model of shared global ownership that is dependent upon open standards development and freely accessible processes for technology and policy development.

# Containers

## Overview

**Containers** are what our applications are going to be running in, which will provide them their own *environment*, repeatable across any machine with *Docker* on it. 

This module discusses common properties for containers and how to manage them.

## Container properties

Each container is created from an *image*, once created it contains properties, the most important ones are:
- **container id**
- **image**
- **command**
- **ports**
- **names**

### Container ID

The **unique identifier** for the *container*, which great for referencing specific *containers* directly.

### Image

Which **Docker image** is being run in the *container*. 

This goes back to the *images* you worked with in the *Images* module.

### Command

Every *container* needs to have a *main process* running, the **command** property shows which *script*, *command* or *executable* was run to create this *main process*.

### Ports

**Ports** column displays what *ports* have been *published* or *exposed*. 

Unlike *published ports*, *exposed ports* donâ€™t alter anything as far as the network is concerned, it's just a form of documentation to understand which *port* the *service running* in the *container* is listening on. 

*Publishing ports* exposes the *service* so it can be reached from outside of the *container* over the *exposed port*.

### Names

**Name** of the container, this is a *property* that can be set to a value more memorable or easy to work with rather then using the one generated by default. 

By *default*, *Docker* will assign a *generated name* if one is not provided.

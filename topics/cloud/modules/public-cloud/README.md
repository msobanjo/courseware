## Overview

A **Public Cloud** is defined as computing services available to *anyone* that wants to purchase or use them *over the internet* provided by a third party.

The way you are charged may vary depending on what resources are being used - some resources may be free, while others may charge by CPU cycles, storage or bandwidth. 

The main difference between a *Private Cloud* and a *Public Cloud* is that the latter may save companies money, as there is no upfront capital expenditure for things like:
- premises
- hardware
- software
- maintenance

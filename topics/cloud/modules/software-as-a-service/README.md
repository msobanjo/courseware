# Description

**Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)** allows everyone to connect to Cloud-based applications over the internet. 

Common examples of SaaS applications would be:
 - Gmail
 - Netflix
 - Office 365

Much like the other Cloud service models, *SaaS* is a pay-as-you-go service which allows you to obtain a complete software solution from a chosen Cloud provider. 

In simple words, you are able to rent an application, which you or your users are then able to access through the internet. 

Everything from infrastructure to data is stored in the Cloud provider's data centre.

The Cloud service provider is responsible for managing all aspects of the service that is provisioned, including availability, hardware, software, security, data, etc.

### Business case

One of the most applicable examples is the email service you use.

It is likely that this application is a SaaS.

The service enables you to log on from anywhere in the world so as to access your emails, whether it be from a browser, mobile app, tablet, or any other Internet-enabled device.

The software itself is stored by the provider in some data centre, alongside your data.

The actual place it is stored is not important, and you as the user need not be concerned; the important thing is that the application runs and can be used from anywhere.

This example refers more to a personal use case.

A business case is similar, where you gain access to services that allow your team to collaborate, use emails, send messages, store data, manage calendar events, etc.

A more advanced application for business purposes would likely include services for **C**ustomer **R**elationship **M**anagement (**CRM**) and **E**nterprise **R**esource **P**lanning (**ERP**).

Here, the business case is more likely to be a subscription based service, or based on some level of usage.

### Advantages

Here are some of the advantages of SaaS:

- There is no need to purchase or maintain:
    - _hardware_
    - _software_
    - _middleware_
 - applications like _ERP_ or _CRM_ become more available, as savings gained from not needing to use in-house software/hardware/middleware can be used for these services instead
- automatic scaling ensures that, based on your usage, you only ever spend for what you use
- the applications used may not need installing, as the majority of them can be accessed through a web browser
- mobile device support
- no data loss if the user's personal machine fails, as everything is kept in the Cloud and made readily available over the Internet

## Overview

A **Hybrid Cloud** is a combination of the *Public Cloud* and *Private Cloud* technologies, and allows data or applications to be shared between them.

Hybrid Clouds can be useful for segregating data.

For instance, you might prefer to keep basic and non-sensitive tasks in the *Public Cloud*, while business-critical data or applications would remain in the *Private Cloud*.

We can think of the *Hybrid Cloud* as a jack-of-all-trades - not only do we get all the benefits of the *Public Cloud*, but we get those benefits without compromising on security.

This allows you to minimise the risk of exposure of sensitive data.

### Advantages

When computational demand fluctuates, by using a *Hybrid Cloud*, you would have the ability to seamlessly scale your on-site infrastructure, without giving a third party provider access to your data. 

The advantages of a *Hybrid Cloud* are:
- greater flexibility
- resilience to outages
- no capacity ceiling
- manageable security

### Disadvantages

However, some disadvantages of a *Hybrid Cloud* are:
- higher capital expenditure up-front
- under-utilization of resources risk
- higher ongoing costs
- more maintenance required
- risk of compatibility issues

### Business Case

Using a *Hybrid Cloud* is most suitable when:
- transitioning to the Cloud
- managing systems that need enhanced security
- managing *internal* systems that require data or applications to be on-premises

## Tasks

Try answering the following questions:

<details>

<summary><b>The <i>Hybrid Cloud</i> is a combination of which Cloud service models?</b></summary>

*Public Cloud* and *Private Cloud* service models

</details>

<details>

<summary><b>Is a <i>Hybrid Cloud</i> more secure than a <i>Public Cloud</i>? Why do you think this is?</b></summary>

Yes, it's more secure than using a *Public Cloud*.

The key reason is that you have the ability to use on-premises architecture, and can enforce your company security policies, rather than having to work with the security policies of the third party Cloud provider.

### Description

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is an environment in the Cloud with all the resources you need for development or deployment of Cloud-based applications.

The resources are purchased on pay-as-you go basis, where access to them is granted through a secure internet connection.

*PaaS* is mainly targeted at developers.

**PaaS** is a stage above **Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)** - it includes all *IaaS* services with the addition of: 
- **middleware**
- **development tools**
- **business intelligence services**
- **database management systems**

With *PaaS* you would avoid the hassle of paying for and managing:
- **software licenses**
- **application infrastructure**
- **middleware**
- **container orchestration**
- **development tools**

The applications and services that are being developed remain the responsibility of the user, while everything else is the responsibility of the Cloud provider.

### Business scenarios

Typical use case scenarios for *PaaS* are:
- **development framework** - a framework is provided for the development of Cloud applications. 
Applications can be created through the built in software components. 
Features such as: scalability, multi-tenancy, and high-availability are included and managed by PaaS.
- **business intelligence and analytics** - tools are provided for data mining, finding patterns, investment returns and for many more business related needs.
- **additional services** - additionally there are services that provide advice in regards to networking, security, scheduling, etc. 

### Advantages

As **PaaS** is built on top of _IaaS_ it offers all of the advantages of the latter, as well as several of its own:
- improving coding efficiency through the use of in-built tools
- development options for multiple platforms 
- sophisticated tools for development, business intelligence and analytics through the pay-as-you go model allows for even the smallest companies to utilise them and therefore save time
- remote teamwork is available, as all the resources are accessible over the internet
- all the capabilities which exist in a typical development environment lifecycle are included - namely building, testing, and deployment```

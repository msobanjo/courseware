## Overview

The main differences between the three models can be summed up as follows:
- **IaaS** gives maximum flexibility for hosting custom built applications or acting as a data centre for data storage
- **PaaS** built on top of IaaS reduces the need for administering the system. 
Frees up time: by not needing to manage infrastructure, time can then be used for development of the application.
- **SaaS** is an out-of-the-box solution ready to be used that meets a specific business use.
Built on top of IaaS and PaaS.

Here's a diagram of the different responsibilities between each model:

When picking which model to use, think about how much control you might require for the given task.

 This will make it easier to decide which model to select.

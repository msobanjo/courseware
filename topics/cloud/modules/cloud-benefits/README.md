## Overview
In this module you will learn about what benefits Cloud technologies offer.

### Scaling in/out

Scaling in and out is a reference to your services automatically reacting to the amount of work they need to do and
 if the resources available are not enough to automatically get more, once the workload decreases the resources are
  released as well.

* Scale Out
    * Cope with spikes in demand (expected and unexpected)
    * Scale out from zero, for batch processing
* Scale in
    * In response to lower demand
    * Automatically based on time of day (peak hours)
    * Lower costs
In the picture below we can see how there is always just a bit more computational power than the demand requires.
 Also based on the amount of users coming to the service there is an increase in the resources required, once the peak
 time is over then the resources are released.

### Cloud provider competencies

Another major benefit is allowing customers to take advantage of the competencies of the cloud service provider. 
* Operating a Data centre is complex and many costs and issues need to be considered:
    * Security, certifications, audits
    * Hardware specifications, warranties, installation, disposal
    * Operating Systems and platform licenses
    * Network configuration and security
    * Software has to be self managed
    
If you were to host your own server, depending on how powerful you will be making it, there are all the previously
 mentioned costs involved to think of before doing so, as you might be spending thousands of pounds before you will
  be able to get your server working.
    
### High availability

Running an application in a variety of physical locations was previous so expensive that only the largest
 organisation could really consider it, and usually only for the most critical of functionality.
  With the cloud, the idea of High Availability is essentially free:
* Same cost to deploy to multiple data centres
* Fewer single points of failure
* Lower latency, high availability

A good example of high availability would be a game server.
 When you play online games you usually choose the server that is as close to you as possible, as this reduces the
  latency and makes it better for you to play. Similarly, if a company has a web application which is generating
   revenue for it, you would like to deploy it closer to where your clients are to make the user experience better
    with the hope of attracting more customers with your provided service.

### Agility

Using the cloud tends to increase agility.
 We’ll see many case studies, later on in this course, where faster time-to-market was one of the major benefits of an
 organisation’s move to the cloud.
  Faster provisioning for (e.g.) new projects.
   Faster introduction of new services:
* In DevOps for example; agile creation, testing and deploying of services
* Continuous Delivery/Deployment
